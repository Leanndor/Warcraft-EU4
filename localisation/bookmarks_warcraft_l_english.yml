 RISE_OF_THE_HORDE_DESC: "Long ago, on the idyllic world of Draenor, the noble orc clans lived in relative peace with their enigmatic neighbours, the Draenei. But the nefarious agents of the Burning Legion had other plans for both of the unsuspecting races. The demon-lord Kil'jaeden set in motion a dark chain of events that would succeed not only in eradicating the Draenei but forging the orc clans into a single, unstoppable juggernaut of hatred and destruction. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Kingdoms, Arathor has fallen, leaving many of the smaller citystates and villages to declare independence and fight for the right to become an Empire..."
